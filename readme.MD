🎓 Student Record Management System
📘 Overview

The Student Record Management System (SRMS) is a lightweight, web-based application designed to help academic institutions efficiently manage student data.
Built with Python (Flask), it provides a clean interface for administrators to add, view, update, delete, sort, and filter student records — while maintaining data security, validation, and persistence.

This project is developed as part of a BSc Computer Science Thesis at Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest.
